# Perk Mod

This simply adds a bunch of perks. 

The `.py` files (`perk_creator.py` is the main one) are used to create new perk jsons and save them to the relevant location.

The `Too Many Perks` directory can be compressed to be uploaded to Thunderstore as a mod

`PerksCSharp` contains everything needed to compile the `.dll`.
