## Support

I will keep watching for cards strength, try to make sure these cards display their strength that should be there.

Evelyn's traits are prefer using three different curses to deal damage, not the direct damage, So I modify the fourth of burn perk to fit the mods.

Hope you enjoy it and if have any idea or bug, just open a github issue or make a post in the **modding #support-and-requests** channel of the [official Across the Obelisk Discord](https://discord.gg/across-the-obelisk-679706811108163701).
